# WoW Analytics: Mythic+ Season TWW1 (EU & US)

An interactive **Tableau Dashboard** built using data from **World of Warcraft: The War Within (Season 1)**.  
This analysis explores class popularity, specialization trends, dungeon performance, and faction distribution in **Mythic+** runs.

---

## Project Overview

The dataset was extracted from the **Raider.io** and processed through **Google BigQuery**.  
After applying `UNNEST` operations, the dataset expanded from ~4,000 grouped entries to more than **80,000 individual rows**,  
each representing a unique Mythic+ character run.

This dashboard visualizes and compares player behavior across different regions (EU & US) and provides insights into  
balance, performance, and class popularity within the first season of *The War Within*.

# üß© Data Extraction (BigQuery)

This section outlines how the dataset was extracted and prepared in **Google BigQuery** using SQL.

### üìö Source
- **Dataset:** `imposing-medium-475102-u0.WOW_DATA.tww_1_season_2000`
- **Initial volume:** ~4,000 records
- **After processing (UNNEST):** ~80,000 rows  
- **Structure:** Nested JSON (runs, rosters, weekly modifiers)

### üß† Objective
Flatten Blizzard‚Äôs nested data model into a **clean analytical table** where each record represents a single player‚Äôs run, enriched with attributes such as:
- Dungeon name  
- Class & specialization  
- Completion time  
- Faction and region  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Steps

1. **Filtering & Selection**  
   Selected relevant fields like region, dungeon, player info, and performance metrics.

2. **Flattening Nested Arrays**  
   Expanded nested structures using BigQuery‚Äôs `UNNEST()` function:
   ```sql
   UNNEST(run.roster) AS r,
   UNNEST(run.weekly_modifiers) AS modifier
   This increased data granularity from run-level to player-level.

 3. **Feature Engineering** <br>
    Converted milliseconds to minutes for run durations.
   Mapped roles, classes, and regions.
   Cleaned invalid or null records.
   

 5. **Exporting** <br>
   Saved final results to a new table:
   CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE WoW_DATA.tww_1_season_2000_filtered
   Then exported to .csv for Tableau visualization.

### Outcome

 - Produced an analysis-ready dataset optimized for visualization and performance metrics.
 - Enabled Tableau dashboards analyzing:
     - Average run time
     - Class distribution
     - Faction ratio
     - Regional participation

## Tools Used

- **Google BigQuery** ‚Üí SQL data processing, JSON flattening via `UNNEST`
- **Tableau** ‚Üí Data visualization and dashboard design
- **Python / Pandas** *(optional preprocessing)*
- **Warcraft Logs API** ‚Üí Source data for Mythic+ player performance

## Dashboard Visuals

### Alliance vs Horde
- Pie chart comparing total active players by faction.  
- Result: **Alliance dominates (‚âà66%)** compared to **Horde (‚âà34%)**.

### Top 5 Most Popular Classes
- Bar chart showing player distribution among classes.  
- Top performers: **Paladin, Shaman, Evoker, Priest, Death Knight**.

### Top 5 Most Popular Specializations
- Highlights the most played specs in Season TWW1:  
  **Protection Paladin, Augmentation Evoker, Discipline Priest, Enhancement Shaman, Frost DK**.

### Average Run Time per Dungeon
- Displays the average completion time (in minutes) for each dungeon.  
- Most runs take between **28‚Äì35 minutes**.

### Average Score by Dungeon
- Compares average Mythic+ scores achieved in each dungeon.  
- All dungeons maintain similar average scores (~450+).

## Dataset Details

| Field | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| `character_id` | Unique character identifier |
| `class_name` | Player class (e.g., Paladin, Shaman) |
| `character_specialization` | Spec name (e.g., Discipline, Augmentation) |
| `character_faction` | Alliance / Horde |
| `dungeon_name` | Dungeon title |
| `running_time_ms` | Completion time (milliseconds) |
| `score` | Mythic+ score for the run |
| `region` | EU and US |

---

## Key Insights

- The **Alliance** player base is significantly larger (‚âà66%).  
- **Protection Paladins** and **Augmentation Evokers** are the most popular specs.  
- Average Mythic+ score consistency suggests strong player skill parity across dungeons.  
- Most dungeons average **30‚Äì35 minutes** per run.
